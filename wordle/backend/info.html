<h1>Info</h1>
<p>
    This project is built using JavaScript, React and CSS.
    The highscore list is server side rendered, and the list of scores is 
    saved in a MongoDB database. 

    The game is built using React, and most of the logic is on the frontend.
    The algorithm for randomizing a word for the player is on the backend, and
    the backend also handles adding the players score and information to the 
    highscore list.
